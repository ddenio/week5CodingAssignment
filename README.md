Created a Menu App that tracks Magic the Gather Player's Card Collections. This uses a prompt to ask the user what they would like to do (Create a Collector, view a Collector, Delete a Collector, or display all Collectors).

From here, in the 'View a collector' choice, a user can then add or remove cards, asking for the name, set, color, and rarity of the card. These properties will be listed once they are added and viewed under that specific collector.

This program utilizes the JavaScript concept of creating Classes to use code blocks over and over again as needed.
